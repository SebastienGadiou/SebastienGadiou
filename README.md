Hello, I am SÃ©bastien, a French guy from Prague, Czech Republic. I have been living in this country for a while now. I come from an academic background in Biology, specifically Genetics, Molecular Biology, and Microbiology. However, I decided to make a change and venture into the world of Tech and IT since 2014. Since then, I have been happy, open-minded, straightforward, and very curious. I have dedicated myself to expanding my knowledge by learning new things.

After several months of research, I chose Python as my programming language of choice. In my various repositories, you will find my exploration of different areas of Python. This includes, but is not limited to:

1. One dynamic website built and designed using the Python Django Web Framework, with the assistance of Bootstrap libraries and Sqlite for SQL DB. The website is primarily coded in Python, with a few lines (5-6 lines) of JavaScript for certain functionalities that I found easier to implement in JS. It also utilizes HTML and CSS. The website was deployed LIVE for approximately 8-9 months. It was a valuable experience in deploying live projects on a platform and dealing with debugging and other challenges. For now it is turn OFF.

2. One static website primarily used to display my results in a more visually appealing manner.

3. My Python game. This project arose from an opportunity and my interest in OpenCV and its possibilities. I realized that I could create a simple game based on my current idea and OpenCV. However, I am still in the process of development as I encountered some issues. I have also created a small GUI for login and starting the game, which needs improvement as well. The final idea is to save the score of each player and display a fun and entertaining endgame animation based on the player's score. The entire game is coded in Python.

4. Web scraping, data retrieval, and data analysis. This is an area I am currently exploring, which I find very interesting. It is somewhat easier to grasp due to my previous experience with statistics and bioinformatics. I use my static website to display the results.

All my projects include interaction with SQL databases by using the built-in module in Python called sqlite3. 

In the near future, I plan to dig into PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other machine learning-related topics.

It will take me a while to filter and load the correct python files in Github, so if you are interested in my work please be patient and/or contact me , I am learning on my free time.
